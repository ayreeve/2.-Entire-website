# Entire-website

Website designed and created for imaginary company named Entire. Entire is calling itself conscious interior designers with note of animal instinct. Scroll down the page to see why (maybe the team section is hiding the key to this puzzle). 

Used:
- HTML,
- CSS (and then rewritten in Sass – as an exercise)
- RWD
- Grunt, Git
- animal instinct

What’s more?
- my own grid, design, logo and content
